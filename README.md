In my repository i am a creating a simple shelll using C programming 
I collaborated with MK Aaron in order to come to the success of the repository.
We will be using the following process in order to have a successful outcome:
1. prompt
2. parsing
3. forking
4. read of pipes
5. waiting
6. execute

### GCC command to compile:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
